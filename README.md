# civic-parade

A parade of all the latest and greatest projects coming out of the Center for Civic Media.

Civic members: to add your project to the parade, simply add a url to sitelist.txt!

To restart the parade, run the restart-parade app. To do so on a repeated schedule, create a repeated iCal event that opens the restart-parade app as an alarm.
