# civic-parade

A parade of all the latest and greatest projects coming out of the Center for Civic Media.

**Civic members: to add your project to the parade, simply add a url to sitelist.txt**

To restart the parade, run the restart-parade app. To do so on a repeated schedule, create a repeated iCal event that opens the restart-parade app as an alarm.

Note: the [Revolver chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda) is what actually drives the parade.
