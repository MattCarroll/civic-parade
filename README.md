# civic-parade

A parade of all the latest and greatest projects coming out of the Center for Civic Media.

**Civic members: to add your project to the parade, simply add a url to sitelist.txt**

To restart the parade, run the restart-parade app. To do so on a repeated schedule, create a repeated iCal event that opens the restart-parade app as an alarm.

Note: the [Revolver chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda) is what actually drives the parade. In order for Revolver to run in kiosk mode at a slow rate, Chrome needs to be started first, before the parade tabs are opened. This means that Chrome's default tab gets opened first, and becomes part of the parade. This can be set to, for example, https://civic.mit.edu
